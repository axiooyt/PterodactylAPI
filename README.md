# Pterodactyl API

Welcome to the Pterodactyl API repository! This API allows you to interact with Pterodactyl server management software.

## Prerequisites

Before using this API, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the API by running:
   ```
   node /scripts/api.js
   ```

## Hosting HTML Files

To host the HTML files that interact with the API, you can use a live server. Here's how:

1. Install a live server of your choice. For example, you can use `live-server` npm package:
   ```
   npm install -g live-server
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory containing your HTML files.
3. Start the live server by running:
   ```
   live-server
   ```

## Using the API

Once the API is running and HTML files are hosted:

- Access the HTML files through the live server to interact with the API.
- Alternatively, you can directly use the API by sending requests to `localhost:3000`.

## Important Note

Please ensure that the Pterodactyl server is properly configured and running for the API to function correctly.
